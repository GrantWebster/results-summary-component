## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript to dynamically fetch local JSON data

### What I learned

I learnt a lot when it comes to building more dynamic webpages as this was my first attempt of incorporating JavaScript and not just a static html and css site. It was also super challenging trying to get the fetch API working. 

### Continued development

I really would like to focus a lot more on dynamic sites and get comfortable with incorporating JavaScript, and my continued learning of more advanced js with libraries and frameworks.
